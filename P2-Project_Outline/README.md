## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I would like to design a website that will allow users to create an event online to meet with family and friends. The idea was rooted from the loss of family members during the pandemic and not being able to attend the funeral due to the pandemic. I have multiple friends that have
had new babies that I have not been able to meet in person. The website would allow users to schedule events like baby announcements, gender reveals, baby showers, weddings, graduations, birthday parties, funerals and more. I believe that users will find it the website useful 
because the website will be available on PC's and phone. This will allow users to connect on the go or home. This website will give users the ability to mingle with family and friends anywhere at anytime.
### Features
User login/authentication: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
Search: Users will be able to search for availability and previously scheduled events.
Create Event: Users will be able to schedule the wanted events to host virtually
### Technologies
